# Face-Mask-Detection

# Overview

This project is a Face Mask Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras.

The model classifies whether a person in an image is wearing a mask or not. It can be extended for a real time detection using OpenCV and deployed on edge devices.
